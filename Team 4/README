### Project Specifications:

    Pick a data set that you and your group find interesting. (Example source: UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository) 

Links to an external site.. 
Perform data pre-processing, data cleaning, outlier removal, and so on to sanitize your data, if necessary.
Save your data in a .csv file (or other format as appropriate for your data set and project scenario).
Read in data to your program from the .csv file.
Run your model, such as training or inference (or other data processing tools as appropriate)
Display final results in a presentable way (use tables and/or visualizations). 
Perform adequate testing. 
Submit code such as a Python file (.py) or as a Jupyter Notebook) to your project GitHub repository (see details in the next section below).
In your write-up be sure to display the results and describe what you have learned, as well as how these results can be used by others (mention the relevance/significance of the results you've obtained).
Group size: Groups of 3/4. No individuals or pairs. 

### Write-up Details:
Be sure to include the following in your write-up:

    Introduction: Describe your project scenario. Starting out, what did you hope to accomplish/learn?
    The Data: Describe your data set and its significance. Where did you obtain this data set from? Why did you choose the data set that you did? Indicate if you carried out any preprocessing/data cleaning/outlier removal, and so on to sanitize your data.
    Experimental Design: Describe briefly your process, starting from where you obtained your data all the way to means of obtaining results/output. 
    Beyond the original specifications: Highlight clearly what things you did that went beyond the original specifications. That is, discuss what you implemented that would count toward the extra-credit portion of this project (see section below).
    Results: Display and discuss the results. Describe what you have learned and mention the relevance/significance of the results you have obtained.
    Testing: Describe what testing you did. Describe the unit tests that you wrote. Show a sample run of 1 or 2 of your tests (screen captures or copy-and-paste is fine).
    Conclusions: Summarize your findings, explain how these results could be used by others (if applicable), and describe ways you could improve your program. You could describe ways you might like to expand the functionality of your program if given more time.

### Submission:

    Pay close attention to these submission requirements:
        Each team will have a project GitHub repository.  (1) your code as Python file(s) (.py) or Jupyter Notebook; (2) write-up (as markdown); (3) your presentation visuals; (4) any other supplemental files or resources as appropriate. [Note: don't submit your video here]
        Each group will need to create a video presentation of their Semester Project. Each student needs to present a section, so be sure to stitch together your presentations into one final video presentation. Your video presentation should be about 5~10 minutes in total. 
        Each student will evaluate two (2) other groups by submitting to Canvas, Your instructor will determine which groups you will evaluate. 
        Attend the live session. Your group will need to present your project abstracts and highlights. There will be a few minutes of Q&A after each presentation. 
        Conduct peer evaluations within your group. Your instructor will post the link to the form as an announcement. Please complete this portion after the project (including live session) is complete. Fill out this form even if you are completely satisfied with all members of your group.
    Submission location: under Assignments on Canvas (to be released).
