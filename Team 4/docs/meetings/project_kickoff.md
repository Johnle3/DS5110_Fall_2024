will probably want to use Zoom going forward)

 I think we agreed on a dataset found on Kaggle that combined stock prices and reddit world news posts.

 the dataset
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaron7sun/stocknews>

 The idea being we can use some of the Amazon NLU and AutoML features while practicing serving the model using a Sagemaker Pipeline. Using this dataset could help us
 get practice integrating two different datasources
 practicing ideas for scaling (reddit and stock tickers are massive datasource) after our POC
Pulling from APIs as Stock (Yahoo finance) and Reddit APIs are also easy and cheap to access in general and this could be a good practice for a learning how to build a continuous or more likely batch data pipeline.

Nothing is set in stone and happy for any ideas you may want to try out and explore.

We will probably put some time on Professor Fox's calendar soon-ish (not sure the date -- was thinking this Sunday around 4 pm but also open to some other day) in order to make sure we are on track for proposal expectations and what she's expecting for around the midterm time.

In the meantime.
I think we had a takeaway of doing some EDA on the data and sketching a diagram / solution vision with the data and  what we would want the project to do then seeing what makes the most sense.  No work was assigned yet.

here is what some teams did last Semester, if you want an idea

still a bit unclear when and when we have to submit this "Midterm" stuff but midterms are usually around mid October (but nothing on the calendar) -- this is what was in Canvas under Midterm Module

I think I can speak for Nathan (Nicholas) when I say we are both still pretty open, right now if you like the set and idea feel free to poke around. I will set up a project Github for us to use so look out for invitations soon (Nathan I'll add both your ids ðŸ™‚)

hope that helps! Nathan let me know if you agree with this or have any thoughts!
