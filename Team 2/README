BigDataSystems-Fall 2024: Team 2

Members: Isidro Pride, Abhinandan Mekap, John Le

Introduction:

The Data: 
The data set for the project will be an astronomy related data set. The dataset will be provided by the professor. This is the basic data set chosen. As the data has not been recieved, we have not carried out any preprocessing or cleaning of data.

Experimental Design: 
We set up a Step Function within a state machine. This will take input payloads and generate AWS Lambda fmi_executor payloads. 
We created three State Machine trials/executions​. We used the pre-existing MyStateMachine-e5ydt2afc state machine. We updated 'world_size' parameter within the 'Lamda Init' function for our trials, specifically using 2, 8, and 32​

Beyond the original specifications: Highlight clearly what things you did that went beyond the original specifications. That is, discuss what you implemented that would count toward the extra-credit portion of this project (see section below).

Results: Display and discuss the results. Describe what you have learned and mention the relevance/significance of the results you have obtained.

Testing: Describe what testing you did. Describe the unit tests that you wrote. Show a sample run of 1 or 2 of your tests (screen captures or copy-and-paste is fine).

Conclusions: Summarize your findings, explain how these results could be used by others (if applicable), and describe ways you could improve your program. You could describe ways you might like to expand the functionality of your program if given more time.
